R-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
Luis Alberto Alaniz Castillo

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers
within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six
activities (WALKING, WALKING\_UPSTAIRS, WALKING\_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING,
STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the
waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured
3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant
rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data
manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two
sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the
training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by
applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows
of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor
acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components,
was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration
and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low
frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency
was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by
calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

For the peer graded assigment the train and test data sets were merged
keeping only the mean and standard deviation of all the features in the
time and frequency domain. The mean and standard deviation of the
features were averaged by subject and activity giving rise to the
current data set.

For each record it is provided:

-   Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration)
    and the estimated body acceleration.
-   Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
-   A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
-   Its activity label.
-   An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:

-   'README.txt'

-   'Codebook.txt'

-   'run\_analysis\_summary\_dta.txt': The assigment data set.

Notes:
======

-   Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
